# Advent Of Code: Casual Puzzle Solving

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges where I'm having a blast solving coding puzzles. 🧩

I'm tackling these puzzles with my girlfriend, using C# and Python respectively. It's pretty cool how we end up with different strategies each time. It's like a fun coding experiment!
